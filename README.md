# AI-Powered-Face-CNIC-Verification-with-Liveness-Detection

This project implements an AI-driven face recognition and CNIC verification system with liveness detection. It uses Dlib for face detection and feature extraction, OpenCV for real-time processing, and SciPy for eye aspect ratio (EAR) calculation to detect blinking as a liveness test. The system:
✔️ Detects & extracts face embeddings from both a real-time camera and a CNIC image.
✔️ Performs liveness detection using eye-blink detection.
✔️ Matches face descriptors between the selfie and CNIC image to verify identity.
✔️ Ensures high accuracy & security by leveraging deep learning-based facial recognition.

🔹 Tech Stack: Python, OpenCV, Dlib, NumPy, SciPy, Tkinter
🔹 Use Case: Secure authentication for identity verification (e.g., KYC, online registration).
